Here you will find routines to generate [Discrover](https://github.com/maaskola/discrover) packages for different Linux distributions.

Linux distributions for which package generation routines are currently available include:

 * [Debian](https://www.debian.org/)
 * [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
 * [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/)

Note that the Gentoo ebuilds are also contained in [my fork](https://github.com/maaskola/sci) of the [gentoo-science overlay](https://github.com/gentoo-science/sci).
I'm currently trying to get the changes in my fork to be included upstream (see [this pull request](https://github.com/gentoo-science/sci/pull/297)).
